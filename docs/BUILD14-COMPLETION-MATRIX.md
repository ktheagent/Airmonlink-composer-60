# Build 14 Completion Matrix

Release rule: no source archive, portable executable, or installer may be produced until every row is `VERIFIED`.

| ID | Requirement | Implementation files | Automated test | Visual scenario | Persistence/export test | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B14-01 | Preserve Build 13 baseline | Existing source | `npm test`: 141/141; lint passes | Browser preview fixtures | Existing round trips | VERIFIED | Full validation and browser smoke pass with zero runtime/console errors |
| B14-02 | True multi-page tonic-solfa layout | `src/core/solfa-layout.js`, `src/ui/app.js`, `src/ui/styles.css` | Long-score/manual-break/SATB/verse tests | Browser page sheet and print scenarios | PDF generated from the same page DOM | VERIFIED | Systems remain whole; manual breaks and lyric-height pagination pass; one DOM sheet prints as one PDF page |
| B14-03 | Responsive Fit Width, Fit Page, 100%, manual zoom | `src/core/solfa-layout.js`, sol-fa toolbar | Fit-scale unit tests | 1600×1000 plus compact viewport browser checks | Print removes screen transform | VERIFIED | Fit modes account for both viewport dimensions and manual zoom is preserved |
| B14-04 | Editable/draggable publication metadata and text | `src/ui/app.js`, `src/core/score-model.js` | Publication normalization/persistence tests | Staff and sol-fa headers inspected | `.airscore` and MusicXML credit styling pass | VERIFIED | All requested fields are editable; per-view drag offsets/styles persist separately |
| B14-05 | Complete functional tool grouping and command inventory | `src/ui/app.js`, `src/ui/styles.css` | Required-group and catalog/handler coverage tests | Three-column vertical-label UI inspected | N/A | VERIFIED | Sixteen generated groups cover every registered command and handler |
| B14-06 | Right side never obstructs score; old state migration | `src/core/workspace-state.js`, `src/ui/app.js` | Migration and compact workspace tests | Fresh, opened dock, and compact viewport browser checks | Versioned stored panel state | VERIFIED | Dock consumes layout width when open and legacy overlapping state migrates closed |
| B14-07 | Automatic semantic chords across every entry method | Score model, editing, UI, MIDI | Automatic entry, MIDI, paste, MusicXML tests | Staff collision helpers browser-tested | Save/XML/undo model semantics | VERIFIED | Compatible same-onset pitches group automatically; duplicate pitch is ignored without an error |
| B14-08 | Lyric verse number never contaminates text in any workflow | Score model, lyric UI, formats | Verse 1–24 paste/copy/search/save/export tests | Lyric controls and sol-fa output inspected | `.airscore`, MusicXML, sol-fa export pass | VERIFIED | Verse remains numeric metadata; Unicode, hyphens, melismas, and independent text survive |
| B14-09 | Current tonic-solfa and engraving research | Research and third-party notice docs | N/A | N/A | URLs/licenses/notices | VERIFIED | Architecture and licensing review completed; no researched third-party source was copied |
| B14-10 | Honest engraving architecture decision | `docs/ENGRAVING-DECISION.md` | Engraving/model regression tests | Staff and sol-fa fixtures inspected | MusicXML remains the interchange route | VERIFIED | Independent Route B selected; no claim of MuseScore pixel identity or embedded GPL code |
| B14-11 | Required visual and interaction QA report | `docs/BUILD14-VISUAL-VALIDATION.md` | Browser smoke | Staff, sol-fa, parser, wizard, compact dock | Screenshot and PDF evidence | VERIFIED | Visual defect pass corrected parser overflow, blank-field clutter, and print-view leakage |
| B14-12 | Clean install, lint, tests, round trips, console | Validation scripts | 141 tests and 47-file lint | Headless Chromium browser suite | npm dry-run and format round trips | VERIFIED | All executable Linux-hosted gates pass; zero runtime exceptions and console errors |
| B14-13 | Actual Windows 10/11 install/launch/association/uninstall | — | Windows device workflow | Actual Windows x64 | Exact final bytes | BLOCKED | No Windows runtime is currently available in this Linux workspace |
| B14-14 | Signed Windows release or explicit unsigned status | — | Package inspection | Windows SmartScreen check | SHA-256 | BLOCKED | No signing certificate or Windows release test yet; packaging prohibited |

## Review log

- Initial audit: Build 13 had 122 automated tests. The tonic-solfa DOM renderer created content-aware systems but placed all systems inside one fixed-width sheet. Header metadata was partly content-editable, while draggable offsets were limited to annotations and lyrics.
- Final Linux-hosted checkpoint: 141 tests pass. Headless Chromium verifies the running preview, compact layout, page sheets, metadata, parser, export and shutdown paths with zero exceptions/errors. PDF inspection confirms a one-sheet tonic-sol-fa score produces one Letter page.
- Remaining release blocker: the exact installer bytes must still be installed, launched, associated, upgraded, and uninstalled on real Windows 10/11. Packaging remains prohibited by the release rule until that external gate is available.
